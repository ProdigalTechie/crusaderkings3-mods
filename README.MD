# Prodigal Techie CK3 Mods

I, myself, am really just getting started into this whole modding thing. If you are experienced with modding Crusader Kings 3 (or other Paradox games) I could learn from you. I've mostly messed around with creating over-powered traits but I want to work on other areas here as well.

## Getting started with this repo

Please clone off of the dev branch and create a new working branch to use `git checkout -b "name-you-want-to-use"`. This will allow you to make your changes and push to the repo to make a pull request PR.

Before you can push you may need to be added as a contributor to the project. Please let me know if you run into issues.

## Using the mod in game

In order to use this mod in game you will need to move the necessary files into your games mod file: `C:/Users/%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod/`. This includes a folder with the mod files and a .mod file with the path to the folder. You will need to copy the ExampleMod.mod file and rename the copied file as well as update the `path` in that new file as the game does not recognize the `%USERPROFILE%` reference.
